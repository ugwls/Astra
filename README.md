NASA space app challenge

The tool will fetch data from different sources providing us Earth Observations (EO) and local crowdsourced data from different regions. This data will help us create a model that will give out warnings after analyzing the data if any signs of an unusual heat stress intensity are recorded and will also provide mitigation measures. The tool will evaluate the data and measure the human and the ecological impact at different levels(e.g., city, state, country). The tool can be accessed easily through a smartphone or PC providing heat stress warning levels (Red, Yellow, Green) for easy understanding. The tool will have a very simple user interface keeping the important data and warnings readily available for the user.
